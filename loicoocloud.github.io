        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>CF Industries is at the forefront of producing blue ammonia, a low-carbon energy source achieved by capturing and storing CO<sub>2</sub> emissions produced during ammonia manufacturing. This initiative significantly reduces the carbon footprint compared to conventional ammonia production methods.</p>

        <h2>Donaldsonville Complex</h2>
        <p>Located in Louisiana, the Donaldsonville Complex is the world's largest ammonia production facility. CF Industries plans to invest $198.5 million to construct a CO<sub>2</sub> compression and dehydration unit at this site. This project aims to capture up to 2 million metric tons of CO<sub>2</sub> annually, enabling the production of approximately 1.7 million tons of blue ammonia each year. <a href="https://www.opportunitylouisiana.gov/news/cf-industries-announces-198-5-million-plan-to-produce-blue-ammonia-at-donaldsonville-complex" target="_blank">Learn more</a></p>
